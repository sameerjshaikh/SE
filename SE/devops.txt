What is DevOps?
DevOps Stages
DevOp Tools
DevOps Use Case

Waterfall Model:
Linear and sequential.
Requirement
Design
Implement
Test
Deploy
Maintenance
Limitations:
  High amounts of risk and uncertainty
  No working software is produced until late during the life cycle
  Once it reaches the testing phase, it is difficult to go back and change something that was not well thought out in the concept stage.
  Not good for Complex and OO Projects
  Not suited for projects where requirements are at moderate to high risk of changing.
Agile methodology
Each project is broken into several iterations. All iterations must be of the same time duration b/w 2 to 4 weeks. At the end of each iteration, a working  product should be delivered. 
Discover->Design->Develop->Test->Deploy
Limitations:
Dev part is Agile
Operations were not stable. 

Solution is DevOps
Development Team and Operations Team.
Good quality software in time.
Happens thro tools of the devOps. 
Continuous development and deployment. 
Version control:
Maintaining different version of the code. to maintain the code we use git. 
continuous integration: Pull the code and prepare the build: Compiling, validating, code review, UNit testing and integration testing. 
Jenkins will do the job.
Continuous deployment is done with Dockers. Continuous monitoring is done later.
Source Code Management: 
clear is used to clear the screen.     
git init
